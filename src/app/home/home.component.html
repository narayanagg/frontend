      That first impression can do a lot of different things. You can use it to
      increase sales, ask for referrals, get shares, point people to interesting
      content, help people get the most out of a purchase, or start a welcome
      series that leads up to a different goal. Even if it’s just for your email
      newsletter and not trying to get sales—your welcome email it a huge
      opportunity. Make sure it does more than confirm a subscription.
